# Circular Music: Design Philosophy

## What human capacities does the modern web suppress — and how can my system require them?

The modern web suppresses:

- patience
- listening
- timing
- ambiguity tolerance
- shared silence
- responsibility without identity

This piece should require these to function well.

## Theme 1: Attention as a Shared Practice (Not a Resource)

### Real-world grounding

- Algorithms optimize for capture.
- Human connection requires sustained attention.

### Structural rule

- The system improves when users stay, not when they act quickly
- Rapid interaction degrades quality
- Waiting is meaningful

### Musical implementation

- Sounds bloom only after sustained presence
- Quick actions produce thin, unstable output
- Silence increases future clarity

### Visual implementation

- Nothing reacts instantly
- Gradual sharpening
- Over-stimulation blurs form

### Why this actually helps

You are training:

- patience
- non-performative presence
- shared temporal awareness

No messaging. Just consequence.

## Sound Atom: Noise clicks / noise bursts, neutral sound

Noise doesn't become music because it's repeated. It becomes music because it's repeated with care.

### Implementation

- Track inter-event timing consistency per user
- Reward low variance, not speed
- Ignore frantic interaction

### Musical result

- Irregular blips begin to quantize softly
- Rhythmic implication emerges without hard grids
- Beats are suggested, never enforced

Think: pulse before beat.

```
chaos → pulse → pattern
```

Also include silence!, perhaps when low activity of users.

Harmony emerges as spectral order, not chords.

### Technique Ideas for creating spectral sounds from the noise

- Gradual band-pass narrowing
- Formant-like filtering
- Spectral centroid stabilization
- Resonant filters that "lock" under repetition

## Long-Term Musical Form (Live Website Friendly)

You don't want loops. You want states.

### Example macro-states

1. **Diffuse** – noise, sparse, unstable
2. **Pulsing** – rhythmic suggestion
3. **Focused** – narrow spectrum, resonance
4. **Clear** – sustained, harmonically stable
5. **Fragile** – clarity that can be lost

Transitions are slow and reversible.

Importantly:

- No state is labeled
- No state is "best"
- Clear states require maintenance, not conquest

## Player Interactions

### Attentive Agency

- "If I do X, I feel the system change"
- No fixed outcomes
- Progress is internal and perceptual
- Encourages listening, timing, restraint

---

## Agency by Macro-State

### Diffuse — Unreliable Agency

- Actions dissipate
- Space doesn't "hold" intention
- You feel present but ineffective

This teaches patience without punishment.

### Pulsing — Temporal Agency

- Timing starts to matter
- Repetition stabilizes effects
- You feel rhythm, not control

Agency exists, but only through time.

### Focused — Directional Agency

- Small choices have predictable influence
- Attentive movement shapes outcomes
- Sloppiness still works, but less well

This is where users feel skilled without power.

### Clear — Relational Agency

- Your actions matter because of others
- Acting alone changes little
- Acting with others sustains clarity

This is social agency, not individual.

### Fragile — Restraint as Agency

- Not acting is powerful
- Overaction degrades
- Presence is contribution

This is the rarest form of agency online.
